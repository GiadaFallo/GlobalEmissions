Visualize GHG emissions


The visualization allows to analyze the change in emissions (CO2, N2O e Methane) in various countries of the world. Moreover it is possible to analyze the change in total greenhouse gas emissions that are composed of CO2 totals excluding short-cycle biomass burning (such as agricultural waste burning and Savannah burning) but including other biomass burning (such as forest fires, post-burn decay, peat fires and decay of drained peatlands), all anthropogenic CH4 sources, N2O sources and F-gases (HFCs, PFCs and SF6). 


There are three aspects of the visualization:

  1. The first one is the spatial representation of the dimension, a choropleth map of the world has been implemented where each coloration of the country is related to the particular emission considered;
  
  2. The second one is the important representation of trends in emissions during a particular slot of time (1980-2011), if data are available for a shorter period of time trends are however available (i.e., Russian Federation (1992-2011) (temporal aspect); 
  
  3. The last is a quantitative aspect that allows to analyze:
  
        (a) which main source sectors are involved in greenhouse gas emissions year by year, for both single country and the whole word.
  
        (b) which source sub-sectors are involved in the CO2 emissions year by year, for both single country and the whole word.
